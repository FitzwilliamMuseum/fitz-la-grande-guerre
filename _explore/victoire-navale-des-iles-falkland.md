The Battle of the Falkland Islands took place on 8 December 1914 and was a success for Britain, effectively ending German naval presence on the high seas. However it came about in reaction to a significant British defeat by the Germans, which had inflicted damage to Britain's reputation. At the Battle of Coronel on 1 November, Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock and his crew of 1,600 were killed off the coast of central Chile by five German cruisers led by Admiral Maximilian von Spee. This earlier battle is alluded to in the print's caption, but not fully explained, showing that the publishers assumed the audience would be up-to-date with current affairs. Only one of the four cruisers - the Dresden - escaped, although this too was sunk in March 1915.

Compare this ocean scene to [no. 23]({{site.baseurl}}/explore/l-honneur-des-marins-francais) of the series, executed by a different artist. In the earlier print the artist makes more use of the printing ink over the surface of the lithographic stone to create a hazy atmosphere, the air full of vapour. Here, the artist relies heavily on the application of colour to delineate form and the choppy water. It is very possible that the artist was influenced by depictions of naval battles of the First Sino-Japanese war (1894-95), such as this one illustrated below, from a volume of the printed book _Nisshin senso emaki_ ('Picture book of the Sino-Japanese war'), Vol. 2 of 10, Suzuki Kason, 1895, Tokyo.

Falkland Islands naval victory. Four German cruisers attacked and sunk by the British fleet  
Our English Allies had been deeply affected by the loss of the 'Monmouth' and 'Good Hope'. They sent a strong fleet to avenge Admiral Cradock. Vengeance was not kept waiting. The Vice-Admiral Sir Frederick C.D. Sturdee, commanding the British fleet, sank four German cruisers near the Falkland islands: the 'Liepzig', 'Scharnhorst', 'Gneisneau' and 'Nirmberg,'sailing under chief commander Admiral Von Spee. The battle lasted five hours: the 'Scharnhorst' sank after three hours and the 'Gneisenau' two hours later: the light enemy cruisers were pursued and dispersed. It was a great sea victory for our Allies. (8 December 1914).
